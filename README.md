# Secure-Campus-Area-Network
"Secure Campus Area Network" tailored for NIIT University, utilizing Cisco Packet Tracer for simulation, configuration, and implementation. By integrating essential security components such as VLANs, Port Security, DHCP, and SSH, the project aims to address security vulnerabilities and establish a network infrastructure conducive to teaching, learning, and administrative operations. This project explains how devices communicate with each other over a network and what important protocols a user needs to configure between the interconnected devices to get enhanced security. The project architecture consists of different departments that are the same as our university and are housed in various buildings.
